# AE_MH_Intervention
Predict if a mental health intervention is needed for an A&amp;E patient. This is part of a bigger modelling system and uses Logistic Regression, RandomForest, and RandomizedSearchCV Classifier. The application has the capability to make predictions based on multiple categories, such as trying to predict whether a patient or list of patients will have a mental health intervention or not, finding out primary and secondary diagnoses, and more. It has also has a live demo feature that takes in user data in Excel (.xlsx) format and displays how many, and which patients will have a mental health referral.

This is a work in progress and will be updated regularly as the project moves along.
